==================================== BUILD ====================================
The Application can be built using either 'mvn package' or by building from
within an IDE that has been setup to use maven.

All external libraries should be installed and the application can be run
by running 'java -jar target/WhereToWalk-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar' from
the same directory that contains 'pom.xml'

Java 21 is the minimum supported version

Warnings generated while the application is running can be safely ignored
as these are due to the version of javafx being used

================================== LIBRARIES ==================================

javafx:
Used for the windowing and overall look of the application

json:
Used for loading the list of hills
